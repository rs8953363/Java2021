      2) How to create "variables"
         a)Type data type
         b)Type a name for the variable
         c)"="
         d)Value
      3) Data Types;
         a) "int" ==> integer: Whole numbers like 2, 132, -54, 0
         b) "double" ==> decimals: Range is larger
         c) "float"  ==> decimals: Range is smaller than double's range

    /*
        Note: If you create a variable inside a method, you should "initialize" it.
              "int price1;" means you created a variable
              "= 100" means you initialized the variable
        Note: If you want to see "default values" create the variables
              outside the methods

        Note: If a method is static, everything you used in the method
              must be static

        Note: If you do not assign any value for a variable, Java uses "default values"
              for them. Default values for
              a)int ==> 0
                Note: int's are whole numbers from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
              b)double ==> 0.0
              c)float ==> 0.0
                Note:When you assign a value for a float variable use "f" or "F" at the end
              d)char ==> nothing or '\u0000'
              e)byte ==> 0
                Note: byte's are whole numbers from -128 to 127
              f)short ==> 0
                Note: short's are whole numbers from -32768 to 32767
              g)long ==> 0
                Note: long's are whole numbers from -9,223,372,036,854,755,808
                to 9,223,372,036,854,755,807
        Note: Order the number data types in ascending order
              byte < short < int < long < float < double
