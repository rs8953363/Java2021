     1)We create methods out of the main method and use them in main method to make main method simpler
     2)static methods can use just static class members because of that we have to make our methods to
     be able to call them from main method.
     3)The variables which are created in method paranthesis are called parameters ==> num1 and num2
     4)The values which are used in main method call are called as arguments
     5)For number parameters you can use "chars" but do not use "String" or "boolean" otherwise
     you will get COMPILE TIME ERROR

      Method Overloading
      If you create methods whose names are same, parameters are different in a class
      it is called "method overloading"

      When you use same name for methods in a class, Java complains.
      To stop complaining we have to change parameters
      Changing access modifier will not stop complaining
       Changing return type will not stop complaining
       Removing static keyword will not stop complaining
